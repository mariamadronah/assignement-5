                Remember, the Word of God liveth and abideth. All right, speak the Word and it will live in
                the lives of men who hear you. He said, "I watch over my Word." He will watch over the
                Word you preach and teach. Jesus said, "If my words are living in you and you are speaking them, I will live in them as they pass from your lips." The Word of Christ becomes a
                Living thing in your lips. Speak the Word fearlessly. Let the Word live in you gloriously and
                richly
